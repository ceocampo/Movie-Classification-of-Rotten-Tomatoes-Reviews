# Movie-Classification-of-Rotten-Tomatoes-Reviews
Movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes were used to build a model to predict whether or not a review would be "fresh" or "rotten" based solely on the text of the review.

# Project Overview
- We have a dataset from the moview review website RottenTomatoes.com.
- The dataset includes written reviews on movies, the names of each critic, review date, and a verdict of whether of not a movie was consider "Fresh" (positive review) or "Rotten" (negative review).
- The goal of this project is to use the text in each review to create a model to predict whether or not a review is considered "Fresh" or "Rotten" based solely on the information extracted from the text review alone.

Technologies used: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
